# Argilla SME Project Setup (WIP)

Oceanid now uses **Argilla** (deployed in-cluster at `http://argilla.apps.svc.cluster.local:6900` and exposed at `https://label.boathou.se`) for SME annotation. The former Label Studio workflow has been removed. This page summarizes the in-progress Argilla rollout and points to the canonical workplans.

## Current Stack

- **Deployment:** see `ARGILLA_DEPLOYMENT.md` and `clusters/tethys/apps/argilla.yaml`.
- **Dataset import:** `clusters/tethys/apps/argilla-importer.yaml` + `ARGILLA_IMPORT.md` describe how Ops hydrate Argilla projects from Hugging Face datasets.
- **Pipeline:** `VESSEL_NER_CLOUDFLARE_WORKPLAN.md` (archived) documented Workers (upload → OCR → NER → Argilla sync → MotherDuck export). Current NER runs via Spark + Ollama Worker.

## What SMEs Can Do Today

1. Request Cloudflare Access to `https://label.boathou.se` (same hostname, new backend).
2. Annotate any dataset that Ops imported via the Argilla importer job.
3. Report issues using the `sme-argilla` label so we can triage per workplan stage.

## Migration Workplan Snapshot

| Stage | Description | Reference | Status |
| ----- | ----------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1 | Upload handler + R2 pipeline | Workplan §2 | 🚧 in progress |
| 2 | DeepSeek OCR worker | Workplan §3 | 🚧 in progress |
| 3 | Claude entity extractor | Workplan §4 | 🚧 in progress |
| 4 | Argilla sync + webhook export | Workplan §5–6 | 🚧 in progress |
| 5 | MotherDuck export + Postgres sync | Workplan §6 | 🔜 |

## What’s Gone

- Label Studio scripts (`scripts/*ls*`, `SME_DEPLOYMENT.sh`, `esc-sme-config.yaml`) have been removed.
- Flux/Pulumi components related to Label Studio secrets, Access apps, or S3 integration are retired.

## Next Steps for SMEs

- Follow the Argilla workplan issues for rollout status.
- If you need a new dataset, file an issue referencing the importer job + dataset slug.
- Expect a full SME handbook here once the Cloudflare/MotherDuck pipeline is production ready.
> Archived: Label Studio project setup is deprecated. Use Argilla. See `workers/vessel-ner`.
