# Field-to-label mapping for synthetic NER data generation
# Generated from Label Studio vessel registry structured data
# Version: 1.0
# Last updated: 2025-10-17

# Vessel registry fields → NER entity labels
field_mapping:
  # Primary vessel identifiers
  "Name": "VESSEL"
  "IMO Number": "IMO"
  "Flag": "FLAG"
  "Port of Registry": "PORT"

  # Vessel classification & catch
  "Type": "SPECIES"  # Fishing method/target species (e.g., "Pole and Line", or actual species like "Tuna")

  # Temporal information
  "Built in Year": "DATE"

  # Fields to skip (not relevant for NER)
  skip_fields:
    - "Vessel Length (LOA)"
    - "Gross Tonnage"
    - "id"
    - "data"
    - "project"
    - "annotations"

# Template patterns for generating natural language text
# These create realistic sentence structures for training
text_templates:
  - "Vessel {Name} with IMO {IMO Number} is flagged in {Flag} and registered at port {Port of Registry}."
  - "{Name} (IMO: {IMO Number}) operates under {Flag} flag from {Port of Registry}."
  - "The {Type} vessel {Name} bears IMO number {IMO Number}, flag {Flag}, and is registered in {Port of Registry}."
  - "{Name}, a {Type} vessel built in {Built in Year}, has IMO {IMO Number} and flies the {Flag} flag."
